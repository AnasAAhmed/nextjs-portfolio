    "description": "üöÄ Next.js App Router: No More getServerSideProps‚ÄîAnd It‚Äôs NOT New!\n\nMany developers still rely on getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getStaticPaths, but the App Router has been handling this differently for a while now! If you're still using the old way, it's time to level up!\n\nHere‚Äôs how data fetching works in the App Router:\n\n‚úÖ Full Page Static Generation (SSG) ‚Üí Best when the entire page is static\nexport const dynamic = 'force-static';\n\n‚úÖ SSG for a Single Fetch Call ‚Üí Best when only some API calls should be cached\nconst res = await fetch(\"https://lnkd.in/eUKuYScv\", {\n¬†cache: \"force-cache\", // Default behavior\n});\nconst data = await res.json();\n\n‚úÖ Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\nexport const revalidate = 43560; // Revalidate every 12 hours. Just add this varaible in your page.tsx.\n\n‚úÖ Dynamic Routes with Static Generation\nexport const dynamicParams = true;\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n¬†const posts = await fetch('https://lnkd.in/ePA8p_vK) => res.json());\n¬†return posts.map((post) => ({\n¬†¬†id: String(post.id),\n¬†}));\n}\n\nNote: You cant use any hooks and onClicks\n\nThis isn't new, but many developers still don‚Äôt realize that the App Router replaces getServerSideProps and getStaticProps with a cleaner, more efficient approach.\n\nüîπ TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read):\n¬†‚Ä¢ export const dynamic = 'force-static' ‚Üí Use this when you want the entire page to be statically generated (SSG), This can also be used in API Routes.\n¬†‚Ä¢ fetch() with cache: \"force-cache\" ‚Üí Use this when you want only a specific API call to be cached while keeping the rest of the page dynamic.\n¬†‚Ä¢ export const revalidate = X ‚Üí Use this for Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to refresh content after a certain time.\n\n\n\nAre you still using the old way, or have you embraced the App Router?
