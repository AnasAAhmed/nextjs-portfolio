This project was a turning point, helping me grasp how headless CMS solutions work and how to integrate them seamlessly into a frontend application.\n\nLooking back, it’s amazing to see how much I’ve grown since then. Now, after working on multiple full-stack projects, I wanted to finally share this as a reminder that every project, no matter how small, contributes to growth. 💡\nHave you ever revisited one of your first projects?

            "description": "🚀 Next.js App Router: No More getServerSideProps—And It’s NOT New!\n\nMany developers still rely on getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getStaticPaths, but the App Router has been handling this differently for a while now! If you're still using the old way, it's time to level up!\n\nHere’s how data fetching works in the App Router:\n\n✅ Full Page Static Generation (SSG) → Best when the entire page is static\nexport const dynamic = 'force-static';\n\n✅ SSG for a Single Fetch Call → Best when only some API calls should be cached\nconst res = await fetch(\"https://lnkd.in/eUKuYScv\", {\n cache: \"force-cache\", // Default behavior\n});\nconst data = await res.json();\n\n✅ Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\nexport const revalidate = 43560; // Revalidate every 12 hours. Just add this varaible in your page.tsx.\n\n✅ Dynamic Routes with Static Generation\nexport const dynamicParams = true;\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n const posts = await fetch('https://lnkd.in/ePA8p_vK) => res.json());\n return posts.map((post) => ({\n  id: String(post.id),\n }));\n}\n\nNote: You cant use any hooks and onClicks\n\nThis isn't new, but many developers still don’t realize that the App Router replaces getServerSideProps and getStaticProps with a cleaner, more efficient approach.\n\n🔹 TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read):\n • export const dynamic = 'force-static' → Use this when you want the entire page to be statically generated (SSG), This can also be used in API Routes.\n • fetch() with cache: \"force-cache\" → Use this when you want only a specific API call to be cached while keeping the rest of the page dynamic.\n • export const revalidate = X → Use this for Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to refresh content after a certain time.\n\n\n\nAre you still using the old way, or have you embraced the App Router?
